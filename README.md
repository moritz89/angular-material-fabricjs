# CanvasTest

Test creating a canvas with **fabric.js** and hovering **Material** cards over it. The test also
shows how to resize the canvas on window resizes and setting its initial size. It is reactive!

## Open Issues

 - Zooming and panning require a bit of code
 - Decide whether to scale vertically as well
 - Interactive buttons: Material buttons that modify the canvas

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically
reload if you change any of the source files.
